# Hi cool Coder 🤘

## ♌ About Me

- My path as a developer began in 2013. In the programming group, I started with **LogoWorlds (RU)**, then studied **Turbo Pascal** (on MS-DOS!!!). The most interesting process was creating my own game, but I was more interested in creating an engine, so I didn't finish the project. This is how I finished my training in the group in 2015. Until about 2018, I created projects for myself on **Pascal** and **PHP** (DevelStudio), in 2019 I discovered a wonderful **C#** language. It was incredible, I hadn't even thought about another language before, which was a huge mistake. And I studied this language to create a utility for flash of the smartphone ZTE Blade V9 Vita - [BV9Vita (RU)](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=952274&view=findpost&p=88382383). I liked the development so much that I decided to significantly develop the project to [NineVita (RU)](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=952274&view=findpost&p=91409816). And off it went... New projects and new discoveries.

- I am a developer of applications for Windows (if necessary, try it under Linux and Web 😊). Know **C#** (2 years), **Python** (1 year, I know the basics and some specialized things, for example: web parsing, working with SQLite, Telegram bots on aiogram, some payment methods and web requests), **PHP** (studied quite a bit, literally the basics of the basics) and **C++** (I know maybe not too well, but razbI know maybe not super well, but I understand relatively well and can write something simple), use **WinForms**, **Console**, **Markdown** and **Bash** & **Batch** for scripts. Learn: **Rust**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and the basics of **Go**. Previously coded on **Mathcad**, **MATLAB**, **Scilab**, **JPHP (DevelNext)**, **Assembler**, **PureBasic**, **Delphi (7)**, **PHP (DevelStudio)**, **SFX-Macros (RU)**, **Pascal (Turbo Pascal & PascalABC.NET)** and **LogoWorlds (RU)**. I also do various creative things. I am looking for interesting projects and ready for possible cooperation.

- At the end of 2022, I decided to finally move completely to Linux and start a new chapter in software development, and not only software. I also created [a channel in Telegram (RU)](https://ttttt.me/FieryLinux), in which I publish my thoughts and stories. As a starting point, I settled on Manjaro with a KDE environment. The plans for 2023 are to hone their skills in working with Python and Rust. I am also studying in the "initial" web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Although I will develop in C#, it is extremely rare. In early June 2023, I finally decided to try out Fedora with GNOME in the form of the Nobara Linux distribution. He reported all his torments and discoveries in my Telegram channel - [Fiery Linux (RU)](https://ttttt.me/FieryLinux). Since September I began to actively develop my website creation skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). When solving some relatively simple problems, writing the same type of code or “one-time” code, I use ChatGPT.

* 2024 👀 An improvement? Hmm, maybe. We'll see what the new year brings: This year started with me installing Windows 11 for myself (although it happened last year, but I finally got it installed this year). I'm not giving up on Linux, I just want Windows rather than Linux for now + I'm not ready to install Nobara 39 yet because of the switch to KDE, and I'm still waiting for a stable KDE 6. This year was the first time I switched from .NET 7 to .NET 8. That's it for now.

* Year 2024, Part II
I finally mastered GNOME, albeit with a bunch of extensions. Still, it turned out to be convenient for me, KDE 6 is still not fully stable, so I'm waiting for the next version, although I'm unlikely to move to it from GNOME. I still use Windows 11 on a regular basis. Despite the general age of all Windows, a bunch of tweaks help to use it without any problems.

* Year 2024, Part III
I finally realized that Windows 11 this is complete... 🤬🤬🤬🤬
I'm back on Windows 10, and I never regretted it, almost all the features of Windows 11 were successfully integrated by me into the system, Windows 11 is garbage, so I don’t regret the downgrade. The second system I installed KDE neon, because I wanted to move away from the gnome and return to KDE. For now, like this, I’m sitting on Windows 10 and KDE neon. Yesterday (June 22) I finally decided to close the issue with WSL2, it was cool. A full-fledged (or something like that) system I have it, and even on Windows 10. Fuck you shitty Windows 11, just fuck you.

* Summer of 2024.
My ardor faded, I decided to return to version 11 of a wonderful buggy, but compatible, system. So far everything is fine, but mostly thanks to my scripts and third-party tweakers from [my new repository](https://github.com/Zalexanninev15/awesome-windows-tweaks).
