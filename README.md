# Hi cool Coder 🤘

## ♌ About Me

# My Developer Journey

## Beginnings (2013-2018)
My journey as a developer began in 2013. I joined a programming group and started with **LogoWorlds (RU)**, later transitioning to **Turbo Pascal** (yes, on MS-DOS!). The highlight for me was building my own game, but my true interest lay in developing an engine, which led to me leaving the project unfinished. I completed my training in the group in 2015 and continued creating personal projects in **Pascal** and **PHP** (using DevelStudio) until around 2018. 

In 2019, I discovered **C#**. This was a game-changer — I hadn’t even considered other languages before, which in hindsight was a huge oversight. With C#, I created a utility for flashing the smartphone ZTE Blade V9 Vita: [BV9Vita (RU)](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=952274&view=findpost&p=88382383). My enthusiasm for development grew, and I expanded the project into [NineVita (RU)](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=952274&view=findpost&p=91409816). And from there, it all started — new projects and new discoveries.

## Skills and Technologies
I primarily develop applications for Windows (with occasional experiments on Linux and Web). Here’s a quick summary of the technologies I know and use:
- **Languages**: **C#** (5 years), **Rust** (1 year), **Python** (2 years; experienced in basics, web parsing, SQLite, Telegram bots with `aiogram` (version 2, but at the moment I'm writing on version With an eye on the future), web requests), **PHP** (beginner), **C++** (enough to handle basic tasks), the initial Web (vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript), **C++** (six months).
- **Frameworks & Tools**: **WinForms**, **Console**, **Markdown**, **Bash**, and **Batch** for scripts.
- **Previously Used**: **Mathcad**, **MATLAB**, **Scilab**, **JPHP (DevelNext)**, **Assembler**, **PureBasic**, **Delphi 7**, **Pascal (Turbo Pascal & PascalABC.NET)**, and **LogoWorlds (RU)**.

I'm always on the lookout for interesting projects and open to potential collaboration.

## Transition to Linux and Growth (2022 - 2024)
At the end of 2022, I decided to fully switch to Linux and start a new chapter in software development. I also created [a Telegram channel (RU)](https://t.me/FieryLinux) to share my thoughts and experiences. I initially settled on **Manjaro** with **KDE**. For 2023, I set goals to improve my skills in **Python** and **Rust**, along with learning basic web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). While I continued working in C#, it became a rare tool for me. By June 2023, I tried **Fedora with GNOME** through the **Nobara Linux** distribution, documenting my experiences on my channel.

In September 2023, I began seriously developing my web skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and even used **ChatGPT** for quick solutions to repetitive or simple code. As of August 2024, he switched from ChatGPT to **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**, and I'm already writing large sections of code on it, which are not interesting to write manually or are too labor-intensive, and there is no output.

## The Windows-Linux Dance (2024)
**2024** began with me finally setting up **Windows 11**. While I haven't abandoned Linux, Windows suits my needs for now, especially as I await a stable release of **KDE 6**. This year also marked my shift from .NET 7 to .NET 8.

Later in 2024, I experimented more with GNOME, adding numerous extensions to make it work well for me. Despite **KDE 6**'s release, I remained with **GNOME** on **Nobara** for stability. However, I continued using Windows 11 with various tweaks for a smoother experience.

**June 2024**: I reached a breaking point with Windows 11's issues and downgraded to Windows 10, where I managed to implement almost all of Windows 11’s features. I set up **KDE neon** as a secondary system and finally configured **WSL2** for a pseudo-native Linux experience on Windows 10.

## Back to Windows 11, But On My Terms (Summer 2024)
After some time, I decided to return to **Windows 11** – it’s buggy yet compatible. Thanks to a series of personal scripts and third-party tools, my experience is much smoother now. Check out my [awesome-windows-tweaks repository](https://github.com/Zalexanninev15/awesome-windows-tweaks) for my collection of tweaks. The year is already coming to an end, but thanks to my special tweaks from all over the Russian-speaking Internet (and not only), I feel incredibly comfortable using Windows 11, so I don't need Windows 10 anymore, but still I sometimes run Linux distributions in a virtual machine.

## 2025

I'm still using the same Windows 11 installed in July. I've learned how to combine the power of Linux and excellent Windows compatibility.

## From August 2025 to the present

My life has changed a little. From developing projects in "adult programming languages," I moved on to writing scripts in Bash and Python for automation. I am an intern at the same company, which is why I completely immersed myself in the world of Linux and threw myself away. I only use Windows at home, and then only for games.  I will say this, Having your own server is cool!

I use **JetBrains Rider** (C#), **JetBrains PyCharm** (Python), **GitHub Desktop** (GUI for Git on Windows) For all and web: - **Visual Studio Code**, and **Notepad++** on Windows or **Notepad Next** on Linux. And also **Total Commader (my build based, based on 3 builds from different authors)** for of all my needs on Windows.
