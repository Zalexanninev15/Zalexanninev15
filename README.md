## â™Œ About me

- My path as a developer began in 2013. In the programming group, I started with **LogoWorlds (RU)**, then studied **Pascal** (on MS-DOS!!!). The most interesting process was creating my own game, but I was more interested in creating an engine, so I didn't finish the project. This is how I finished my training in the circle in 2015. Until about 2018, I created projects for myself in **Pascal** and **PHP** (DevelStudio), until in 2019 I discovered a wonderful **C#** language. It was incredible, I hadn't even thought about another language before, which was a huge mistake. And I studied this language to create a utility for flash of the smartphone ZTE Blade V9 Vita - [BV9Vita (RU)](https://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=952274&view=findpost&p=88382383). I liked the development so much that I decided to significantly develop the project to [NineVita (RU)](https://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?showtopic=952274&view=findpost&p=91409816). And off it went... New projects and new discoveries. Now, in 2021, I already know **C#** quite well (well, for myself), I am actively studying **Python**, I understand **Bash** and **Batch**, I comprehend the complexities of **C++**, I write scripts in **PHP** and do many other interesting things... even with an **Assembler**!

- I am a developer of applications for Windows (if necessary, try it under Linux and Web ðŸ˜Š). Know **C#** (2 years) and **Markdown**, use WinForms & Console and **Python** & **PHP** & **Bash** & **Batch** for scripts. Learn: **WPF**, **C++**, **MATLAB**, **Scilab**, **HTML**, **Assembler**. Previously coded on **Mathcad**, **JPHP**, **PureBasic**, **Delphi**, **SFX-Macros (RU)**, **Pascal** and **LogoWorlds (RU)**. I also do various creative things. I am looking for interesting projects and ready for possible cooperation.
