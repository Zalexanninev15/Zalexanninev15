## ♌ About me

- My path as a developer began in 2013. In the programming group, I started with **LogoWorlds (RU)**, then studied **Turbo Pascal** (on MS-DOS!!!). The most interesting process was creating my own game, but I was more interested in creating an engine, so I didn't finish the project. This is how I finished my training in the group in 2015. Until about 2018, I created projects for myself on **Pascal** and **PHP** (DevelStudio), in 2019 I discovered a wonderful **C#** language. It was incredible, I hadn't even thought about another language before, which was a huge mistake. And I studied this language to create a utility for flash of the smartphone ZTE Blade V9 Vita - [BV9Vita (RU)](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=952274&view=findpost&p=88382383). I liked the development so much that I decided to significantly develop the project to [NineVita (RU)](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=952274&view=findpost&p=91409816). And off it went... New projects and new discoveries. 

- I am a developer of applications for Windows (if necessary, try it under Linux and Web 😊). Know **C#** (2 years), **Python** (1 year, I know the basics and some specialized things, for example: web parsing, working with SQLite, Telegram bots on aiogram, some payment methods and web requests), **PHP** (studied quite a bit, literally the basics of the basics) and **C++** (I know maybe not too well, but razbI know maybe not super well, but I understand relatively well and can write something simple), use **WinForms**, **Console**, **Markdown** and **Bash** & **Batch** for scripts. Learn: **Rust**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript** and the basics of **Go**. Previously coded on **Mathcad**, **MATLAB**, **Scilab**, **JPHP (DevelNext)**, **Assembler**, **PureBasic**, **Delphi (7)**, **PHP (DevelStudio)**, **SFX-Macros (RU)**, **Pascal (Turbo Pascal & PascalABC.NET)** and **LogoWorlds (RU)**. I also do various creative things. I am looking for interesting projects and ready for possible cooperation.

- At the end of 2022, I decided to finally move completely to Linux and start a new chapter in software development, and not only software. I also created [a channel in Telegram (RU)](https://ttttt.me/funnypenguin), in which I publish my thoughts and stories. As a starting point, I settled on Manjaro with a KDE environment. The plans for 2023 are to hone their skills in working with Python and Rust. I am also studying in the "initial" web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Although I will develop in C#, it is extremely rare. In early June 2023, I finally decided to try out Fedora with GNOME in the form of the Nobara Linux distribution. He reported all his torments and discoveries in my Telegram channel - [Путь в Linux (RU)](https://ttttt.me/funnypenguin).
