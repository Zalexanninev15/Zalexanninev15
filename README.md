# My Developer Journey

## Beginnings (2013-2018)
My journey as a developer began in 2013. I joined a programming group and started with **LogoWorlds (RU)**, later transitioning to **Turbo Pascal** (yes, on MS-DOS!). The highlight for me was building my own game, but my true interest lay in developing an engine, which led to me leaving the project unfinished. I completed my training in the group in 2015 and continued creating personal projects in **Pascal** and **PHP** (using DevelStudio) until around 2018. 

In 2019, I discovered **C#**. This was a game-changer â€” I hadnâ€™t even considered other languages before, which in hindsight was a huge oversight. With C#, I created a utility for flashing the smartphone ZTE Blade V9 Vita: [BV9Vita (RU)](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=952274&view=findpost&p=88382383). My enthusiasm for development grew, and I expanded the project into [NineVita (RU)](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=952274&view=findpost&p=91409816). And from there, it all started â€” new projects and new discoveries.

## Skills and Technologies
I primarily develop applications for Windows (with occasional experiments on Linux and Web). Hereâ€™s a quick summary of the technologies I know and use:
- **Languages**: **C#** (5 years), **Rust** (1 year), **Python** (2 years; experienced in basics, web parsing, SQLite, Telegram bots with `aiogram` (version 2, but at the moment I'm writing on version With an eye on the future), web requests), **PHP** (beginner), **C++** (enough to handle basic tasks), the initial Web (vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript), **C++** (six months).
- **Frameworks & Tools**: **WinForms**, **Console**, **Markdown**, **Bash**, and **Batch** for scripts.
